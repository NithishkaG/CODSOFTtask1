# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

## Overview

This project is part of my virtual internship at Codsoft. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques based on various features such as age, gender, and class.

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Model Development
- Model Evaluation and Prediction

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers and their survival status.



## Usage

- Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to see the analysis and model training steps.
- To make predictions on new data, use the provided script:
  ```bash
  python src/predict.py
  ```

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
